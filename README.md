# odin-recipes
This is a recipe website for "The Odin Project" (TOP).
For the moment, there'll only be HTML, following TOP's workplan.

This project is an introduction to HTML and Git, it'll be useful as a resfresher on web basics, and also as an inspiration for future projects.

This project will consist of several webpages for different recipes, linked from the main page.
